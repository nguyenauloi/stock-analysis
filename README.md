## Overview of Project

Steve is requesting our help to diversify his parent's stock portfolio from just DQ, but is unsure of how to determine what stocks to purhcase. Using VBA, we will be analyzing other green energy stock data to determine what the best options are in order to pursue.

## Results

In our table above we see that in 2017 almost all of the stocks had meaningful returns.

### 2018 Data

In this table we see that it is the opposite of 2017, where most of the stocks are delivering negative returns. 

## Summary
The goal of this project was to diversify Steve's parent's stock portfolio away from just DQ and pursue other green energy stock. As we can see in our charts above there are obvious tickers that we could eliminate: TERP, who has not had a return for the two years, as well as SEDG and AY whose return is less than 10%. I would recommend moving forward with DQ, ENPH, RUN, and VSLR as the best options for large returns and low loss potential.
